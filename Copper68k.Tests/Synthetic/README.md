# Synthetic integer instruction suite

The accepted [implementation plan](../../docs/COPPER68K_SYNTHETIC_INSTRUCTION_SUITE_PLAN.md)
defines the six milestones. The suite uses the public factory and test-internal
architectural specifications, a sparse 32-bit recording bus, independent operand
fixtures and a common register/PC/SR/memory verifier. It never calls production
decoders, arithmetic, effective-address or timing helpers to compute expectations.

## Deterministic gate

From the CopperMod root, run:

```powershell
./scripts/test-copper68k-synthetic.ps1
```

MOVE/MOVEA and transfer/address operations currently execute **901,424 logical
cases** in **90 xUnit batches**, across seven models and the A1200 profile.
Ordinary `dotnet test Copper68k.Tests/Copper68k.Tests.csproj -c Release` includes
these batches. CI additionally validates every required report and exact count;
missing reports, mismatches, unsupported execution and empty groups fail the gate.
The following instruction sentinel verifies extension consumption.

Reports contain per-scenario identifiers and counts for passing, mismatching,
unsupported and untested outcomes. `integer-inventory.json` lists all integer
families and their model-specific architectural outcomes. The validated
`qualified-inventory.json` promotes only completed milestone families; later
families remain explicitly untested. Reserved/undefined full extensions and
excluded FPU/MMU/physical timing work are identified separately. Diagnostic
68010/68060 results do not qualify desktop readiness.

MOVE coverage is separated into opcode enumeration (9,726 legal words per
profile), boundaries/CCR, extensions/aliases, overlapping operands, external
address boundaries, invalid opwords and alignment. Full indexed fixtures cover
66 legal structural combinations. Transfer tests reuse the same fixtures for
LEA/PEA and MOVEM, and cover spaced MOVEP bytes, masks, aliases, model exceptions,
register encodings and preserved CCR bits.

## Seeded and external audits

```powershell
./scripts/test-copper68k-synthetic.ps1 -Deep -Seed 68020 -Samples 10000
./scripts/test-copper68k-synthetic.ps1 -Deep -Models 68000,68020 -Seed 123456 -Samples 20000
```

Recorded xorshift32 seeds add MOVE samples without expanding the deterministic
Cartesian product. Zero seeds, empty/unknown model selections and nonpositive
sample counts are rejected. Each invocation uses a fresh report directory.

External audits reuse existing adapters; append the appropriate switches:

```powershell
-SingleStepPath <SingleStepTests-directory>
-MusashiPath <pinned-Musashi-checkout>
-WinUaePath <generated-cputest-directory> -WinUaeLibrary <native-tester.dll> -WinUaeSourceCommit <40-hex-generator-commit>
```

Requested references must exist, select inputs and pass. Input SHA-256 identities,
source revision and native library identities are recorded. Musashi is pinned to
`72c1d74800f3087b45a0c1a7342601bbed898881`. SingleStepTests is a MAME-generated
software oracle, not a hardware capture. The available WinUAE integer adapter is
68000-specific; its generator's broader model support does not establish adapter
or input qualification. Unrequested or unavailable references are not passing
coverage. Cross-model external qualification remains milestone 6 work.

[MC68060UM](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MC68060UM.pdf).
Undefined decimal-operation flags are masked in future decimal scenarios.

## Replacement proofs and retained tests

```powershell
./scripts/test-copper68k-synthetic-mutations.ps1
```

Six isolated mutations prove detection of absolute-address decoding, extension
length, signed indexes, source/destination alias order, A7 byte stride and MOVE
flags. The command restores source in `finally`, rebuilds it and records each
mutation, precise failing replacement case and source hash. A compilation failure
does not count as detection. Do not run it concurrently with a build or edit of
the same production file.

No specialized regressions have been retired. Existing focused MOVE tests whose
unsupported boundary became legal execution were updated to assert the result.
Cache, prefetch, detailed fault ordering, bus timing, JIT and native media tests
remain separate. These semantic results preserve existing timing policy; they do
not certify physical timing or OS compatibility.
